# TODO: Remove Unnecessary Comments from Codebase

## Overview
Remove unnecessary comments from all code files while keeping important comments that explain how things work (e.g., docstrings, fix notes, logic explanations, section headers).

## Files to Edit
- [ ] src/models.py: Remove verbose comments; keep section headers, fix notes, and docstrings.
- [ ] src/config.py: Remove simple labels; keep comments explaining configuration logic.
- [ ] src/database.py: Remove redundant comments; keep docstrings and key explanations.
- [ ] src/etl.py: Remove excessive inline comments; keep docstrings, fix notes, and logic explanations.
- [ ] src/sql/create_schema.sql: Remove verbose SQL comments; keep essential table structure notes.

## Steps
1. Edit src/models.py to clean comments.
2. Edit src/config.py to clean comments.
3. Edit src/database.py to clean comments.
4. Edit src/etl.py to clean comments.
5. Edit src/sql/create_schema.sql to clean comments.
6. Verify code functionality (e.g., run syntax checks or ETL script).

## Followup
- Test the ETL process to ensure no functionality is broken.
- Commit changes if satisfied.
